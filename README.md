# DBeaver

#CONNECTION

DBeaver has a lot of pre-configured driver including SQL, NoSQL, key-value databases, graph databases, search engines, etc. But sometimes you need to connect to a database which was not configured in DBeaver yet. All you need is JDBC driver of your database.

For more information: https://dbeaver.com/docs/wiki/Database-drivers/

Click on the plug and select your Database

Once the Database has been selected and connection has been stablished, make sure the connection shows correctly in the tool menu when starting a new script.

#SCRIPT

When creating a new script, make sure you use the language that your database uses (most likely SQL).
